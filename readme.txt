Yelp Database Application

This is a command-line based Yelp recommendation system that allows users to search for businesses, search for users, make friends, and write reviews.

To start the application, you have to first run the python file. You will then be prompted to enter your Yelp user ID.

Once you have entered your user ID, you will see the main menu. Use the numbers 1-5 to select options from the menu.

The available options are:
1. Search Businesses
2. Search Users
3. Make Friend
4. Write Review
5. Exit

Selecting an option will prompt you for additional information as needed.
